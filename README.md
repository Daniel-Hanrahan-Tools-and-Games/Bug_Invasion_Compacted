# Bug_Invasion_Compacted
Compacted version of Bug_Invasion is written in Lua

Notice/title screen takes ten seconds to load the game on browser or you can press fire green bullet.

Controls: Arrow keys or D-Pad to move, z on keyboard or a on xbox style controllers to fire green bullet, x on keyboard or b on xbox style controllers to fire red bullet, s on keyboard or y on xbox style controllers to fire yellow bullets, a on keyboard or x on xbox style controllers to fire blue bullets and if you are asking yes I modeled the button control scheme after the xbox style controller buttons.

The executable and source code is in one file.

To load the file you drag the file into Tic-80 or have it loaded into your sd card if you are using raspberry pi bare metal.

To run the game after you loaded the game you type in run then press enter.

To get to source code after you loaded the game you press escape key.

This is a one to one port for the most part with the exception of addon mod support.
